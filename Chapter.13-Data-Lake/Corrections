modify the main.js file to see the lines in the graph.  This is due to change in how AWS saves JSON in S3 in 2023


line 16 had: url = url.trim()+"+"
and now: url = url.trim()

Regarding main.js I see other differences between what you have in the book and what is now in github:

in the book: if(url.replace("iot/test/", "+") != "")//Your key folder name
in github (line 21): if(url.replace("iot/test/", "") != "")//Your key folder name
